	<p>Westeros is one of the four known continents in the known world. Most of the area of Westeros is controlled by the political entity known as the Seven Kingdoms, while the far north beyond the Wall includes the free folk. The closest foreign nations to Westeros are the Free Cities, a collection of independent city-states across the narrow sea in western Essos. To the south of Westeros lie the Summer Isles. The continent of Westeros is long and relatively narrow, extending from Dorne in the south to the lands beyond the Wall. In the far north are the frozen Lands of Always Winter, where a large amount of land remains uncharted due to the extremely cold temperatures.</p>
	<p>The Seven Kingdoms consist of many regions: The North, The Iron Islands, The Riverlands, The Vale of Arryn, The Westerlands, The Crownlands, The Reach, The Stormlands and Dorne. The north is the largest region, nearly as large as the rest of the regions combined. The Iron Islands are a group of islands lying off the western coast of Westeros in Ironman's Bay, the largest being Blacktyde, Great Wyk, Harlaw, the Lonely Light, Old Wyk, Orkmont Pyke, and Saltcliffe. The riverlands, located south of the Neck, are the fertile areas between the Red, Green, and Blue Forks of the Trident, as well as the Gods Eye and much of the Blackwater Rush. The Vale lies to the east of the riverlands, surrounded almost completely by the Mountains of the Moon. The westerlands are the lands to the west of the riverlands and north of the Reach. It is a smaller region, but is home to some of the richest gold and silver mines on the continent. The crownlands are lands ruled directly by the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.The Reach is the largest region except for the north; it encompasses a region of the most fertile part of Westeros and numerous well-populated villages and towns. The stormlands, located south of King's Landing, stretch down to the Sea of Dorne and are bordered by Shipbreaker Bay in the east and the Reach in the west. It is one of the smaller regions of Westeros, a land of harsh mountains, stony shores, and verdant forests. Dorne is the southernmost region of Westeros. It stretches from the southern Red Mountains near the Dornish Marches to the southern coast of the continent. It is the hottest kingdom in Westeros and features the only desert on the continent. </p>
	<p>Westeros experiences extremely long seasons with varying lengths, usually lasting a couple of years. It's very different to predict the length of the seasons so food is always being stored to prepare for winter. </p>
	<p>The fourth main sentient species of Westeros are humans, giants, Children of the Forest(the first beings to inhabit Westeros) and the Others(a mysterious undead race of creatures bent on enslaving all of mankind.)</p>
